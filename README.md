# Benchmarking Tools and Standards

This repository contains specifications for implementing benchmarking tools.
We also provide links to our reference benchmarking engines and their
implementations.

** Note: This is work in progress. **

# Standards and Definitions

See [doc/standards/index.md](doc/standards/index.md) for the current
benchmarking standards and definitions.

# Benchmarking Intermediate Files

The benchmarking process contains a variety of steps and inputs. In
[doc/ref-impl/index.md], we define standardise intermediate formats for
specifying truth sets, stratification regions, and intermediate outputs from
comparison tools.
