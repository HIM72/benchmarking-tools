Low complexity bed files from the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Benchmarking Team and the Genome in a Bottle Consortium

These files are intended as standard resource of bed files for use in stratifying true positive, false positive, and false negative variant calls into different types of low complexity regions (e.g., homopolymers, STRs, VNTRs, other repetitive sequences).  

These files were collated and/or created by Justin Zook at the National Institute of Standards and Technology based on discussions in the GA4GH Benchmarking Team.  There are 2 sets of files, along with merged files:
1. Repeats downloaded from TRDB for hg19 on 3/31/15 (Human_Full_Genome_TRDB_hg19_150331.txt).  We created a bed file from this in GRCh37 format (Human_Full_Genome_TRDB_hg19_150331.bed).  Then, we subsetted only repeats with >=95% identity.  We further subsetted these into those with a unit length <=6bp or >6bp, and then to those with a total repeat length <50bp, 51-200bp, or >200bp. Files are named as Human_Full_Genome_TRDB_hg19_150331_TR{repeat unit}_{total repeat length}_{% identity}identity_merged.bed (e.g., Human_Full_Genome_TRDB_hg19_150331_TRgt6_gt200bp_gt95identity_merged.bed contains repeats with a unit >6bp and a length >200bp with >95% identity). All of these files were generated using TRDB_processing.sh.  These files include imperfect repeats, but not all short homopolymers and tandem repeats, so we also generated #2 below.

2. To create bed files with exact 1, 2, 3, and 4 bp repeats of different lengths, we used the python script findSimpleRegions_quad.py in this directory (created by Geoff Nilsen, and modified by Justin Zook to output 4-bp repeats).   To generate these files, we used the GRCh37 fasta from 1000genomes.org without decoy sequences (human_g1k_v37.fasta). The shell script used to generate these was FindSimpleRepeats.sh, which used findSimpleRegions_quad.py along with BEDTools-Version-2.16.2.

3. We merged the repeats from TRDB and findSimpleRegions_quad.py in 3 size ranges: <51bp, 51-200, and >200bp.  Simple homopolymers >5bp, simple tandem repeats 11-50bp, and all TRDB repeats <51bp were included in the <51bp merged bed file (/Users/jzook/Downloads/AllRepeats_lt51bp_gt95identity_merged.bed).   Simple tandem repeats 51-200bp, and all TRDB repeats 51-200bp were included in the 51-200bp merged bed file (/Users/jzook/Downloads/AllRepeats_51to200bp_gt95identity_merged.bed).   Simple tandem repeats >200bp, and all TRDB repeats >200bp were included in the >200bp merged bed file (/Users/jzook/Downloads/AllRepeats_gt200bp_gt95identity_merged.bed). These files were generated using TRDB_processing.sh along with BEDTools-Version-2.16.2. 

Note that flanking regions are not currently included in the bed files, only the repeats themselves.

An alternative merged low complexity bed file generated by Heng Li is in ../unimask/01compositional.bed.gz
