Functional region bed files from the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Benchmarking Team and the Genome in a Bottle Consortium

These files are intended as standard resource of bed files for use in stratifying true positive, false positive, and false negative variant calls into different functional or potentially functional regions.  

refseq_union_cds.bed.gz is the union of RefSeq coding sequences generated by Kevin Jacobs.  Details of how the file was generated will follow.

refseq_union_cds.sort.bed.gz is the same file sorted in numerical chromosome order with only 1-22, X, Y, and MT
