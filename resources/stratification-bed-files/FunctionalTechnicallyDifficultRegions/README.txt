Functional technically difficult region bed files from the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Benchmarking Team and the Genome in a Bottle Consortium

These files are intended as standard resource of bed files for use in stratifying true positive, false positive, and false negative variant calls into different functional or potentially functional regions that are also likely to be technically difficult to sequence.  

BadPromoters_gb-2013-14-5-r51-s1.bed.gz was generated from the list of difficult-to-sequence promoters (http://genomebiology.com/content/supplementary/gb-2013-14-5-r51-s1.txt) from the paper http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/5/R51 (doi:10.1186/gb-2013-14-5-r51).  In the paper they are described as:
“Anecdotal results suggested that many transcription start sites or first exons in the human genome tend to have poor coverage. By a systematic analysis of these regions we defined the 1,000 with the lowest relative coverage based on low coverage by an Illumina data set, which we term the 'bad promoters' list (see Materials and methods). The bad promoters are, like many exons, GC-rich (averaging 79% GC composition).”
