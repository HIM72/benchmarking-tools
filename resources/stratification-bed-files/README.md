Stratification files from the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Benchmarking Team and the Genome in a Bottle Consortium

These files are intended as standard resource of bed files for use in stratifying true positive, false positive, and false negative variant calls into different categories.  For example, these files could be used in conjunction with the GA4GH variant comparison tool being developed or other comparison tools to find how accuracy compares in low vs moderate GC content, or in different types of repetitive regions. Additional files will likely be added over time.  

These files were compiled by Justin Zook from the National Institute of Standards and Technology based on discussions in the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health Benchmarking Team and the Genome in a Bottle Consortium.  A description of the idea behind these files is in a google doc at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jjC9TFsiDZxen0KTc2Obx6A3AHjkwAQnPV-BPhxsGn8/edit?usp=sharing.
