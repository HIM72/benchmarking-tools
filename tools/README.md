# Reference implementations

This directory contains submodule links to tools that serve as reference implementations of the benchmarking 
standards agreed upon by the ga4gh data working group. Cloning the repository will also pull these tools 
(use `git clone --recursive`). Clicking on the submodules on the github repository will take you to the 
tool repositories.
